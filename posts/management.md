Jogging down some thoughts on being a teamlead

## My teamlead experience: the glorified facilitator

- identified major timeing issues the moment I became the teamlead and communicated to the company
- Highly autonomous team, no need for micro management
- Mainly learn about the past present and future to help facilitate progress

## Being a teamlead is not about just saying "no"

- noticed a full team sitting in a corner of the office and looking all solemn
- found out they have to manually update some values which would take them a full afternoon to complete
- offer to help and delivered. delivered my own hack project as well
- saved CS and dev time of internal team, and user have a good experiences of viewing the map

## Being the beacon of light

- Things will feel dark and purposeless. Good teamlead can bring light to the direction where we should be going.
- align team member personal interest with the business

## Dream a little

- being teamlead is not just about delivering features

## Talk to people

- talk to customer
- talk to CS, marketing
- talk to internal teams
