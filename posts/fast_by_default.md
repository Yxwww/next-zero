Reduce:

- unnecessary calls
- memory leak
- long running main thread procedures
- long GC calls

## Chunking down heavy work

powerful utils enables processing large data by chunks asynchronously

## Parallel by default

any non main-thread dependent operation should be delegated to web workers

## All operations must be cancellable

Even a for loop needs to be cancellable

## All creations must be destroyed

Any entity generated by the application, whether it's an element, event handler, state, or loaded data, must be properly disposed of when no longer needed.
