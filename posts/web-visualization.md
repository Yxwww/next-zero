# Retrospect - Working with Web 3D Visualization

Undertaking visualization projects is both challenging and rewarding, especially within the web ecosystem's constraints. I aim to reflect on my proudest accomplishments to fuel future progress.

## Accomplishments

Reflecting on my past work, several aspects of the project bring a smile to my face. These accomplishments range from introducing new rendering model, developing a worker pool toolkit, and completely redesigning the frontend stack, to crafting custom UI widgets for sophisticated interactions. Below is a compilation of these accomplishments, accompanied by high-level insights gathered along the way.

### Performance Improvements

Performance Improvements Overview:

- Boosted fps from <10 to 60 in various contexts
- Expanded rendering model size from dozens of MB to multiple GB

[Accomplishments]

- Redesigned UI and visualization architecture for enhanced performance
- Developed a worker pool library to alleviate JS main thread load
- Implemented a reactivity/state management system inspired by Svelte runtime for application scalability

#### Thoughts on making performance improvements

- take time profile your application
- making something seems fast vs actually making something fast
  - both are important skill
- being in the environment where making things better/faster is desired
- understanding and having full control over what the application is doing at any given moment
  - this includes UI part of JS: watch out for frameworks
  - having full stack experience enables you go further: let backend handles heavy duty work

#### Atitude

> Wait a second, things don't have to be this slow.

> If we rewrite this in [insert another programming language], things will be so much faster

I haven't encountered a project where using JavaScript is the difinitive bottleneck for building a fast application.

> "As a developer, we are directly responsible for making our application snappy and easy to use"

### Introducing New models type

### UI Widgets & UX

Annotation, reactivity, maintaning feature parity,

- introduced "loading mode" for models improves UX for user
- colorbar
